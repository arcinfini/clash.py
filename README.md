# clashapi

My implementation of the Clash of Clans API provided at https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/

I am using the project build my understanding of git/github and more advanced python topics. 
Due to my indecisiveness and horrible spelling ability, many outward facing names may change. 
If for some reason you have decided to use my code like the psychopath you are, please keep this in mind

At the moment of writing, the representation of classes is almost done when it comes to players, clans and clan wars. 
I'm really only working on what I plan on using more often.

## Current and Important Features:
- Default rate limiting to 10 requests/second. (The required is never specified but this is widely recommened)
- Yeah thats pretty much the cool stuff I did so far. But hey, I'm looking forward to making an event system.
- I also plan on making most objects easily serializable for database storage (if this is even a cool feature, idk I haven't looked into it much)




# Copy install for my forgetful brain
`pip install git+https://github.com/w-thomas-20/clashapi.git`


Anyway, this is the most I have written in a readme so I'm pretty proud of myself
